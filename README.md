# To-Do Web Application

This is a simple To-Do web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks to manage their to-do list.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended)
- **Text editor** (VS Code or any editor of your choice)
- **Node.js** (if using a server-side JavaScript setup, though this app doesn't require it for basic usage)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nutharaaa/ToDo-App.git
Open the Project Folder: Open the project folder in your text editor (VS Code is recommended).

Open index.html:

Double-click on index.html to open it in your browser.
You should see the To-Do application in action.
For Development:

If you plan to make changes to the code, open the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your editor and make your modifications.
Refresh the browser to see changes.
Running the Project Locally (Optional)
If you are using a server-side framework or development environment, you may need to install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This is optional and only needed if your project has external dependencies (such as React, Angular, etc.).
